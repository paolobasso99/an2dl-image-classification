\section{Comparison between models}
To conclude, we compare the results obtained by the best models, for each technique used.
The validation accuracy is based on the split of the dataset in train and validation set, using as validation a percentage of the dataset varying from 10\% to 20\%.
The accuracy on the training set reached 99\% in almost any case, apart from ConvNeXtLarge, in which it stabilized at 90\%.
The test was made using TTA (\ref{TestTimeAug}) and only for those models reaching a high validation accuracy.
